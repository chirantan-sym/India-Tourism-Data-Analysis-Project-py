# Indian Tourism Analysis

Tourism plays a significant role in India's economy as one of the largest service industries. It is experiencing rapid growth and is vital for the country's economic well-being. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, in 2018, tourism contributed ₹16.91 lakh crore (US$220 billion) or 9.2% of India's GDP, and it supported 42.673 million jobs, accounting for 8.1% of total employment. In 2019-20, tourism was estimated to directly contribute 2.7% to GDP and 6.7% to overall employment in the country.

India's popularity as a tourist destination stems from its diverse range of attractions, which are found throughout the country. Each state in India boasts its own unique tourist offerings. From thrilling wild safaris and mesmerizing desert safaris to serene nature retreats, India has something for everyone. It is an ideal destination for honeymooners, adventure enthusiasts seeking thrilling activities, spiritual seekers exploring sacred places, and history buffs delving into the rich historical sites of India.
